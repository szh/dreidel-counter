Dreidel score counter by Shlomo Zalman Heigh
Written in TypeScript with Angular. I built this in a very short period of time since I only realized I wanted it a few days before Chanukah,
so design decisions were rushed and may not be optimal. Contributions welcome.

Automatically stores game state in localStorage and restores on page load.
Includes "Spin for me" to allow for players who don't have their own dreidel to spin.
Allows undoing of previous turn.

Enjoy!
